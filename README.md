# VirtualPiano
Hello. this is my small project that I made in order of killing the boredom of working alone in the office :)

Right now it's very simple, though I'm planning on adding certain updates in nearest future.

List of updates:
- Adding more instruments,
- Adding higher/lower sound mode,
- Adding turn off/on option for key names,
- Adding RWD features.
- Adding metronome,
- Adding recording option,
- Adding turn off/on reverb,

List of updates done:
- None for now :)
